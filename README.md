This project used the Yelp API to find gas stations and liquor stores locations within the STL metro area and compared their locations to STLPD crime database (https://www.slmpd.org/crime_stats.shtml). We were looking to see if the number of liquor stores in or around a zip code had a correlational relationship with crimes commited within a zip code.

We found the lat/long of the center of each zip code and made a 5000m radius search for all liquor stores.  We then reviewed the number of crimes in the zip code and looked for any correlational relationship.
